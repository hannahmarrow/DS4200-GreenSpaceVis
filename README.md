# Created for Information Presentation & Visualization (DS4200) in Fall 2019.

The principle result of this assignment is two linked visualizations illustrating what residents and pedestrians alike would like to see improved in Chester Park. This web page also contains information about the data collection process, the process of designing the visualization, and the motivation for taking on this project.
